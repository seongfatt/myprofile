### 🎯 My Honest Approach
> “I’m new to data analytics — but I ship real, usable projects.  
> I use Gen AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as my co-pilot to learn faster, debug smarter, and deliver what users actually need.  
> I don’t pretend to know everything — I focus on understanding, validating, and delivering.”

✅ Learning by doing — every repo is a hands-on project  
✅ AI-assisted development — prompts help me write better SQL, design dashboards, clean data  
✅ Client/User-focused — I care about solving the problem, not just writing code

## 🤖 My AI-Assisted Workflow & Prompt Engineering

I believe in leveraging the best tools available, and for me, that includes Generative AI. Many of the projects in this repository are **AI-assisted**, meaning I've used **prompt engineering** to accelerate my work.

This is not a shortcut — it's a productivity multiplier.

| My Honest Use of AI | How It Adds Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Co-pilot for Code** | Generating boilerplate code, writing complex SQL queries, and suggesting efficient Python syntax (Pandas, etc.). |
| **Expert Debugger** | Finding and explaining errors in my DAX formulas, SQL stored procedures, and Python scripts faster than traditional searching. |
| **Documentation & Design** | Helping structure documentation, suggesting logical chart types for a dataset, and refining dashboard narrative. |
| **Learning Accelerator** | Explaining new concepts (like SQL Window Functions) through practical, contextual examples. |

> 🧠 **The Human Work:** I provide the intent, the context, and the data. I **critically review**, **validate**, and **own** every line of code and every insight the AI helps generate.  
> I am the driver; AI is the engine.

### ✅ AI Collaboration Disclaimer

> I actively use Gen AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to support my learning and development.  
> Prompt engineering is part of my workflow — helping me debug, document, and deliver faster.  
> Every project reflects honest effort, critical thinking, and hands-on validation.  
> AI assists me, but I take full responsibility for understanding and refining the work I publish.
