### 🎯 My Honest Approach
> “I’m new to data analytics — but I ship real, usable projects.  
> I use Gen AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as my co-pilot to learn faster, debug smarter, and deliver what users actually need.  
> I don’t pretend to know everything — I focus on understanding, validating, and delivering.”

✅ Learning by doing — every repo is a hands-on project  
✅ AI-assisted development — prompts help me write better SQL, design dashboards, clean data  
✅ Client/User-focused — I care about solving the problem, not just writing code
