<h3 align="center">Newly Certified Data Analyst | AI-Powered Learner | Turning Prompts into Projects</h3>

### 🎯 My Approach
> “I may not have years of experience — but I have curiosity, discipline, and the ability to use Gen AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to understand requirements, debug code, design dashboards, and deliver what clients or users actually need.”

I focus on:

✅ **Learning by doing** — every repo is a real or realistic project  
✅ **AI-assisted development** — using prompts to accelerate understanding and output  
✅ **Client/User-focused results** — even if I need AI help, the final product works and solves a problem

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Data Analysis**: SQL, Excel (PivotTables, VLOOKUP), Power BI, Python (Pandas)
- **AI Collaboration**: Prompt Engineering, AI-assisted debugging & documentation
